üéÆ Game State Management for BeTheMC Complex Architecture

This module provides the core game state management implementation for the complex
architecture. It handles player state, personality traits, events, relationships,
and memories in a structured way that supports the advanced story generation system.

Key Features:
- Comprehensive game state tracking with personality traits
- Event history management with configurable limits
- Relationship and memory systems for story continuity
- Factory methods for creating and loading game states
- Serialization support for save/load operations

Architecture:
- Implements the GameState interface from interfaces.py
- Uses dataclasses for clean, type-safe state management
- Supports complex personality trait modifications
- Maintains event history for story context

Usage:
    from bethemc_complex.core.state import GameStateImpl
    
    # Create a new game state
    state = GameStateImpl.create_default("Pallet Town")
    
    # Update personality based on choices
    state.update_personality({"courage": 0.1, "friendship": 0.2})
    
    # Add events to history
    state.add_event("Met Professor Oak")
    
    # Serialize for saving
    state_dict = state.to_dict()

    üéÆ Game State Implementation
    
    A comprehensive game state implementation that tracks all aspects of a player's
    adventure including location, personality, events, relationships, and memories.
    This class provides the foundation for the complex story generation system.
    
    Features:
    - Personality trait management with bounded values (0.0-1.0)
    - Event history with configurable maximum length
    - Relationship tracking for NPC interactions
    - Memory system for story continuity
    - Pok√©mon partner tracking
    - Location-based state management
    
    Personality Traits:
        - friendship: How well the player gets along with others
        - courage: How brave the player is in dangerous situations
        - curiosity: How much the player explores and investigates
        - wisdom: How thoughtful and strategic the player is
        - determination: How persistent the player is in achieving goals
