    ðŸŽ® Game Manager - API Layer Orchestrator
    
    This class acts as the primary coordinator between the API layer and
    the underlying services. It handles all game-related API operations,
    manages database persistence, and ensures proper error handling and
    response formatting for the FastAPI endpoints.
    
    Key Responsibilities:
    â€¢ API Request Processing: Handle incoming API requests and validate inputs
    â€¢ Service Coordination: Orchestrate calls between GameService, SaveService, and DatabaseService
    â€¢ Response Formatting: Convert internal models to API response schemas
    â€¢ Error Handling: Provide consistent error responses and logging
    â€¢ Database Persistence: Manage game state storage and retrieval
    â€¢ State Validation: Ensure game states are valid before processing
    
    Architecture Role:
    â€¢ Receives requests from FastAPI routes
    â€¢ Coordinates with multiple services (GameService, SaveService, DatabaseService)
    â€¢ Returns properly formatted API responses
    â€¢ Handles all database persistence operations
    
    Dependencies:
    â€¢ GameService: Core game logic and state management
    â€¢ SaveService: Game save/load operations
    â€¢ DatabaseService: MongoDB persistence operations
    
    Usage:
        game_manager = GameManager(game_service, save_service)
        response = await game_manager.start_game("Ash Ketchum")
