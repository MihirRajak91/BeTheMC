ðŸŽ® Core Domain Models for BeTheMC Complex Architecture

This module defines the core domain models that represent the fundamental
data structures used throughout the complex architecture. These models
provide type safety and clear data contracts between different layers
of the system.

Key Features:
- Dataclass-based models for type safety and immutability
- Comprehensive field validation and documentation
- Clear separation between domain models and database models
- Support for complex nested data structures

Architecture:
- Models are used across all layers (API, services, database)
- Dataclasses provide automatic __init__, __repr__, and __eq__ methods
- Field defaults ensure consistent object creation
- UUID generation for unique identifiers

Usage:
    from bethemc_complex.models.core import (
        Player, Story, Choice, GameState, PersonalityTraits
    )
    
    # Create a new player
    player = Player(
        id=str(uuid4()),
        name="Ash Ketchum",
        personality_traits={"courage": 7, "wisdom": 5}
    )
    
    # Create a story segment
    story = Story(
        id="story-oak-lab",
        title="Welcome to Professor Oak's Laboratory",
        content="You step into the bustling laboratory...",
